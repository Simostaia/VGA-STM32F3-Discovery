# VGA Signal Generator using STM32F3-Discovery Board

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage the STM32F3-Discovery board (STM32F303VC) to generate VGA signals for display on a monitor. The application utilizes the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provided in the STM32Cube package along with emWin libraries. Additionally, a custom adapter was designed to establish a connection between the VGA pins and the STM board.

The key features of the application include generating VGA synchronization signals and handling the analog green signal through SPI communication. The VGA signal is adapted to the standard 1V voltage level required by VGA monitors using a voltage divider. Pixel data is efficiently transferred to the display using the Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller. Pixel data manipulation and generation are achieved through the use of the emWin library, configured to work with the GUIDRV_BitPlains driver.

## Introduction

The VGA Signal Generator application is designed to create VGA-compatible signals for display on a standard VGA monitor, using an STM32 microcontroller. It generates synchronization signals and handles the green analog signal communicated to the monitor through SPI. The application incorporates a voltage divider circuit to adjust voltage levels to meet VGA standards.

## Hardware Setup

To use this application, you will need the following hardware components:

- STM32F3-Discovery board.
- VGA Monitor: A standard VGA monitor capable of displaying the VGA signal generated by the MCU.
- Voltage Divider Circuit: To adjust signal voltage levels to 1V for VGA compatibility.
- VGA Adapter: A VGA connector or cable to connect the MCU to the VGA monitor.

Ensure correct hardware connections for the application to function as intended. Refer to the block diagram below illustrating connections between the STM32F3-Discovery and the VGA adapter:

## Software Components

The application utilizes the following software components and libraries:

- **STM32 HAL Library:** Interfaces with the STM32 MCU's hardware resources, including timers, SPI, and DMA.

- **emWin Library:** A graphical user interface library used to generate and manipulate pixel data for the VGA display. The application is configured to work with the GUIDRV_BitPlains driver from emWin.

## Usage

To use the VGA Signal Generator application, follow these steps:

1. Set up the required hardware components, including the STM32 MCU, VGA monitor, voltage divider circuit, and VGA connector.

2. Download STM32CubeF3 and specify its path in the Makefile (the root directory is `STM_DIR`).

3. Modify the `LIBS` and `LIB` variables in the makefile to point at your own copy of the emWin library.

4. To compile the project, run the following code in `p1Gruppo13`:

```
$ make prepare
$ make
```

5. Flash the application to the STM32 MCU using OpenOCD and GDB.
